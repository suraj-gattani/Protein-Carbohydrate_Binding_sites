
**StackCBPRed Software Package**

StackCBPred: A Stacking based Prediction of Carbohydrate-binding Proteins from Sequences

*******************************************************************
StackCBPred is a software used to predict carbohydrate-binding sites 

Note: This is the linux compatible program. 
Note: StackCBPred utilizes DisPredict2 and SPIDER3 to extract features. Thus it is required to install DisPredict2 and Spider3 before running StackCBPred.

Availability of the dependent softwares:
*********************
Dispredict 2.0 is available at:
http://cs.uno.edu/~tamjid/Software.html

SPIDER 3.0 is available at:
http://sparks-lab.org/index.php/Main/Downloads

Setting the PATH of dependent software in the script file (~/StackCBPred_Software/Scripts/StackCBPred):

1) Dispredict_path = "SET PATH to DisPredict2"
2) Spider3_path = "SET PATH to SPIDER3"
3) Software path = "SET PATH to StackCBPred software"

************************************************************************************
Running the software: 

1) cd ~/StackCBPred_Software/Scripts

2) Command to run the software:
./StackCBPred seq_id sequence
example:
./StackCBPred 1a1aa ARDDRDRDRDR

Dependencies: Anaconda3, Java, Perl

***********************************************************************************

After you run the program output will be saved in the Output folder with seq_id.train and seq_id.combined.
[ Seq_id.train output has been obtained by training on the benchmark dataset only.
  Seq_id.combined output has been obtained by training on the benchmark, independent test set1 and independent test set2 together]

Enjoy !!!
Cheers !!!
